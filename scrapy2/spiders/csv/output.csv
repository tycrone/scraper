42,057373178362,3:10 to Yuma [Blu-ray],3:10 to Yuma [Blu-ray],,"Here\'s hoping James Mangold\'s big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of 3:10 to Yuma leads some moviegoers to check out Delmer Daves\'s beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on ""duty,"" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new 3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen star as best friends whose lives are changed by a cancer diagnosis in this new comedy directed by Jonathan Levine from a script by Will Reiser. 50/50 is the story of a guy's transformative and, yes, sometimes funny journey to health - drawing its emotional core from Will Reiser's own experience with cancer and reminding us that friendship and love, no matter what bizarre turns they take, are the greatest healers.-----Un gar\xc3\xa7on de 25 ans apprend qu'il a un cancer mais d\xc3\xa9cide de vivre et de vaincre la maladie.

In a switch from his Inception smoothie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a strait-laced 27-year-old who works in Seattle public radio with his hedonistic best friend, Rogen's Kyle. Back pain brings Adam to an oncologist who diagnoses cancer, prescribes chemotherapy, and recommends counseling, which leads him to Katie, a doctoral student (Anna Kendrick) who makes up in compassion what she lacks in experience. If Kyle takes the news with good humor, Adam's girlfriend, Rachael (Kendrick's Twilight costar Bryce Dallas Howard), puts on a strained smile, while his mother (Anjelica Huston) goes into freak-out mode. At the hospital, Adam also befriends two cancer patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) who share their foul-mouthed wisdom--along with marijuana-laced macaroons--but Rachael finally cracks, leaving Adam to fend for himself, except that he isn't as defenseless as he thought, which comes in handy when he finds out the chemo isn't working. Will Reiser, who wrote the script, drew from his own experience, and the results ring true, even if he's too hard on Rachael, who sincerely tries to be supportive. In his follow-up to The Wackness, which centered around a congenial dope dealer, Levine treats the other characters with more respect, and avoids the sentimentality that mars most movies about potentially fatal illnesses--plus, it's a lot funnier. --Kathleen C.

Will dispose de quelques jours pour le retrouver s\xe2\x80\x99il veut sauver le reste de sa famille.    The Cold Light of Day is most notable for two things. It stars Henry Cavill, the British actor plucked from near-obscurity to be Superman in the 2013 reboot, Man of Steel. It also features an extended cameo appearance from Bruce Willis, who does something he\'s rarely done as a good-guy action hero before. The early-on plot twist is a little shocking, but not necessarily a surprise based on the fact that this is not a vehicle for Willis. It seems to be mostly a tryout for Cavill as a leading man that gives him a chance to practice his American accent. Other than those novelty factors, this clich\xc3\xa9d thriller is a fairly routine exercise in Bourne/Bond espionage action that showcases gunplay, explosions, double-crossing spies, and a fish-out-of-water protagonist fighting for his life against exotic background locales. Cavill plays Will, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur on vacation with his family for a yacht trip in Spain. His father, Martin (Willis), considers Will a disappointing black sheep who cares more about his cell phone than his family. The unsurprising reveal is that Dad is a CIA hotshot whose life of deception was the primary strain between father and son. Before the inevitable reconciliation, the boat and the family disappear while Will is ashore. It\'s a kidnapping in retaliation for Martin\'s extraction of a mysterious briefcase (the contents of which are never revealed) that is wanted by battling geopolitical intelligence factions perfectly happy to kill anyone who stands in the way of their ownership. Will is thrust into the intrigue, frantic with worry over his family and on the run from the authorities for the murder of a police officer he didn\'t kill. His appeal to the US Embassy is fruitless until another shadowy player named Carrack intervenes on his behalf. This cold and ultimately duplicitous character is played by Sigourney Weaver, who adds a much-needed level of credibility to the slapdash narrative and makes the often-wooden dialogue a little livelier. The conflict becomes: who can Will trust when he\'s out in the cold? How about a guileless Spanish beauty who appears as randomly as most every other development in the movie? Lucia (Ver\xc3\xb3nica Echegui, a delightful Pen\xc3\xa9lope Cruz clone) teams with Will in his escape from the multitude of thug spies tracking him, all of them bent on finding the briefcase by any means necessary. Will has to get there first to clear himself, save his family (or what\'s left of it), and find out things about himself he never knew. Cavill makes a bland heroic figure, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing in the larger context. Without Willis and Weaver (who has been channeling the elegant strength of ""Ripley"" primarily for camp value in her later career), The Cold Light of Day probably wouldn\'t have seen the light of day at all. As it is, the movie is a mostly satisfying genre piece perfectly worthy of its workmanlike mix of style and substance. --Ted Fry    ","Will Shaw (Henry Cavill) goes to Spain for a weeklong sailing vacation with his family but his whole world turns upside down when the family is kidnapped by intelligence agents hell-bent on recovering a mysterious briefcase and Will suddenly finds himself on the run.-----Will Shaw, un \xc3\xa9tudiant am\xc3\xa9ricain, part en Espagne rejoindre sa famille pour une croisi\xc3\xa8re pendant les vacances.

","FURRY VENGEANCE is a live action family comedy in which an ambitious young real estate developer, Dan Sanders, faces off with a band of angry animals when his new housing subdivision pushes too far into a pristine part of the wilderness. Led by an incredibly clever raccoon, the animals stymie the development and teach our hero about the environmental consequences of man's encroachment on nature.-----Parfois, quatre pattes valent mieux que deux.
